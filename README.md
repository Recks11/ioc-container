# Inversion of Control Container
A `simple` ioc container that supports dependency injection. provides basic annotations like `@Bean` to create and store beans and `@Named` to specify the name of a bean with of multiple beans of the type exist

### TODO
- Create the @component annotation
- create a class to instantiate projects like the @SpringBootApplication class
- create the annotation to detect an @IOC application
- make a default context startup with applications
- make the application instance check all directories for annotatied classes and load beans [MAJORRR]
- if i remember correctly, there could be a name conflict issue in beans
- i forgot the rest, just do it as you fo.
